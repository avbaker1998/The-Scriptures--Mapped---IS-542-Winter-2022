Homework 5

What I learned:
I am not super familiar with jquery so I loved the website you maynotneedjquery 
because it showed that there is more than one way to do things.
That is something I love about programming. Although there may be 
one way that is better than others, there are still tons of ways to do 
many things!

I also thought it was really interesting how we created all the private 
methods. I haven't taken a Javascript class since IS 303 back in
Winter of 2020 so it has been a hot second. This all is new and
kind of a lot but its something that I am trying to learn. I rewatched
the videos again because I wanted to understand how they work. Do
I fully yet? No. But I will keep working and practicing it!

It makes me super excited seeing the end product, knowing that I 
will be able to make something like it!
